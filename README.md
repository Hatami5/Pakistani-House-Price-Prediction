Overview

This repository contains the code for a machine learning model designed to predict house prices in Pakistan based on various features such as location, size, and amenities. 
The model utilizes regression techniques to provide accurate price predictions, which can be useful for real estate companies, buyers, and sellers.

Training the Model:

You can modify the code to train the model on your own dataset. 
The training code is included in the repository and can be executed directly.

Making Predictions:

Once the model is trained, you can use it to make predictions on new data. 
Load the model and pass the features of the house to get the predicted price.

Modal:

The model used is a regression model built using scikit-learn, designed to handle features specific to the housing market in Pakistan. 
It can be retrained with updated data to refine its predictions.

Requirements
Ensure the following Python packages are installed:

scikit-learn==0.24.2
pandas==1.3.3
